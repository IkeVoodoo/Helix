# Helix
Helix is a next-gen plugin &amp; modding API.

> [!warning]
> Helix is *unfinished*, it will be getting constant updates and breaking API changes until v1, it is not reccomended to use in production at this time.
>
> A few plugins from IkeVoodoo themselves will use this as testing grounds for new API, those are fine to use as I'm actively maintaining them.
